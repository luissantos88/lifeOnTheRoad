# LifeOnTheRoad (Website)

We spend so much TIME on the road that we don´t even realize and stop to actually stop think about it.

Quality of life varies from person to person, but what they all have in common is that it takes TIME to have that quality.

This is a person project to practice front-end skills learned in Academia de Código bootcamp.
## How to use

Just put the minutes you spend on the road in 1 day and you will see how much days of your life you have lost in 1 year.
